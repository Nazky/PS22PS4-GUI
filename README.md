### F.A.Q

#### What is this thing ?

Hi it's a PS2 ISO to PS4 fake PKG, so you can play ps2 iso games on you'r ps4.

#### All games are working ?

No, there is a compatitibility list that you can find [here](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/PS2_Classics_Emulator_Compatibility_List).

#### Why should i use this one and not a other PS2 to PS4 ?

PS2-FPKG is closed source (i have try to find the src but i can't so i guess it is) and i don't really like to use closed source projects lol (the software work and is very good with a lot of features but it's closed source so yeah), a good alternative is PS2 Classis GUI by [TheDarkprogramer](https://github.com/xXxTheDarkprogramerxXx) (a very greate guy btw, luv) but there isn't a lot of options to choose and no support for BIN files, so this project try to combine both of the best world.

#### Why in VB ?

Because why not ? also if i can't update the src for some reason it's more easy to modify and update by others peoples.

#### Can i help ?

YES, you can open a issue or make a pull request.

#### Ok but how do i use it ?

Simply drag and drop a ISO or a BIN, a background image, a game cover and a folder then press "Create PKG" to get the PS4 PKG.

#### But if i want to import a custom config or a LUA file ?

Simply click on "file" then "import".
